    <p id="description">
        This alternate universe has a version of Peter Parker / Spider-Man who lives in the Savage Land. When Peter and his family were flying inside a plane, the engine started burning and Peter's parents gave him the only parachute left in the plane to save him. Peter landed on the Savage Land, where he was raised by a tribe of giant spiders. The spiders made Peter to go under the Trial of 1,000 Venoms, where he was injected different venoms by the spiders to see if Peter would survive. He succeeded, and from the trial he got spider-powers as the Savage Spider-Man. Now with his powers, he protects the land from intruders like Wilson Fisk of the company Kingliner and Ka-Zar the Hunter when they are poaching dinosaurs. There was also a mentioning that Ka-Zar the Hunter's father killed the last of the Man-Things, as he unknowingly sets off one of the Savage Spider-Man's traps that nearly crushes Ka-Zar the Hunter. The Savage Spider-Man then confronts Wilson Fisk, who recognizes him as Peter Parker. A flashback in a discussion between Richard and Mary Parker and Wilson Fisk mentioned that Peter was supposed to stay with his aunt until something happened to his uncle. When Fisk's soldiers show up to attack, the giant spiders also arrive and attack the soldiers, while some of them follow Fisk onto his airplane. The Savage Spider-Man swings away as more giant spiders surround the airplane.
